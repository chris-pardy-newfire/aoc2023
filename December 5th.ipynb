This lets the gardener and his team know which soil to use with which seeds, which water to use with which fertilizer, and so on.\n",

With this information, you know that seed number 98 corresponds to soil number 50 and that seed number 99 corresponds to soil number 51.\n",

    "Any source numbers that aren't mapped correspond to the same destination number. So, seed number 10 corresponds to soil number 10.\n",
